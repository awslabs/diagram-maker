# Demos

We have a few demos with different configurations to showcase different use cases that diagram maker could be used for. Read more about diagram maker configurations [here](/usage/configuration.html).

* **[Left Right Rectangular](/examples/LeftRightRectangular.html)** : Uses a LeftRight connector placement with rectangular shape nodes by default.
* **[Top Bottom Rectangular](/examples/TopBottomRectangular.html)** : Uses a TopBottom connector placement with rectangular shape nodes by default.
* **[Boundary Circular](/examples/BoundaryCircular.html)** : Uses a Boundary connector placement with circular shape nodes by default.
* **[Layout](/examples/Layout.html)** : Uses an initial graph that is setup to test the layout APIs.
* **[Action Interceptor](/examples/ActionInterceptor.html)** : Uses an action interceptor to add every new node that is dragged in with an extra attribute. The extra attribute is a boolean indicating whether the node that was dragged is an odd numbered new node or not. For rectangular nodes, the odd numbered nodes have a Red colored outline and the even numbered ones have a blue outline. Furthermore, when new edges are created, it creates the reverse edge 1 second later.
