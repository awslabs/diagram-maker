# State

This is the interface for the Diagram Maker state object. The state of the entire editor is captured within this structure and can be used to rehydrate an editor with the same state as a previous session, from the persisted state. **Please note** that Diagram Maker itself doesnt provide solutions to persist this state. It provides consumers an API to fetch the graph state at any time. 

Any custom data models for a consumer use case will need to be translated to the DiagramMakerData model for the graph to be re-hydrated. Likewise, the model fetched from Diagram Maker will be in the DiagramMakerData form.

## Structure of the state object
Please note that this state object is for demonstration purposes only. The upto date state object can be found inside the bundled types after installing from NPM.
```typescript

       * Supplied for nodes already present when diagram maker initializes.
       * In the case it is supplied, please ensure that this is unique.
       */

## Accessing the State
This is covered in forthcoming section on APIs as well, but worth mentioning here. The current state can be fetched anytime from the diagram maker instance.

### Fetching the current state
```javascript
const diagramMaker = new DiagramMaker(container, config);
.
.
.
const currentState = diagramMaker.store.getState();
```

### Listening to state updates
```javascript
const diagramMaker = new DiagramMaker(container, config);
diagramMaker.store.subscribe(() => diagramMaker.store.getState()
```
