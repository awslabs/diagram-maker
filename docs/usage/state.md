# State

This is the interface for the diagram maker state object. The state of the entire editor is captured within this structure and hence can be used to rehydrate an editor with the same state as a previous session from a persisted state. Please note that Diagram Maker itself doesnt provide options to persist this state, it does provide consumers an API to fetch the state at any time apart from action interceptors that can provide the state before actions are dispatched onto the store and reducers that can be used to capture the state after an action has been processed by Diagram Maker. Consumers might need to transform their use case specific data structure into this state structure that diagram maker expects as the initialData configuration and might need reverse transformation to extract their use case specific data structures from diagram maker state after customers have modified the elements on the canvas.

## Structure of the state object
Please note that this state object is for demonstration purposes only. The upto date state object can be found inside the bundled types after installing from NPM.

## Accessing the State
This is covered in forthcoming section on APIs as well, but worth mentioning here. The current state can be fetched anytime from the diagram maker instance.

### Fetching the current state
```javascript
const diagramMaker = new DiagramMaker(container, config);
.
.
.
const currentState = diagramMaker.store.getState();
```

### Listening to state updates
```javascript
const diagramMaker = new DiagramMaker(container, config);
diagramMaker.store.subscribe(() => diagramMaker.store.getState()
```
